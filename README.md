## Project Overview

The project is to **develop an autonomous game-playing agent for a strategic board game**. Students will work in **teams of two**, with one submission from each team. The project will be implemented in **Python**. Specifications for the project and submission instructions will be made available, but here you can find an overview.

The project will be divided into **two parts**, each involving **two tasks**.

- **Project Part A** is a 'warmup' project / progress submission (8 marks)
  - Your team will **write a program** to solve a simplified version of the game using search algorithms.
  - Your team will **write a report** discussing the algorithmic design of your program.
- Project Part B is the final submission of the game-playing program (22 marks)
  - Your team will **program an agent** that plays the game against other programs in our simulator.
  - Your team will **write a report** discussing the algorithmic and strategic design of your program.
